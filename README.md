# drg_scout

Project in progress! Will eventually allow user to track how often something(s) is mentioned on all of Reddit. For example, how often is "Italy" mentioned by name, or a list of your favorite Pokemon, etc.

Currently (3/13/23) the project searches for the catch-phrase "Rock and Stone" on the popular subreddit DeepRockGalactic and sends HTTP post requests to a Flask server which stores them in a sqlite database.
